# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to Add a Changeset

When you make changes to this package, you should add a changeset to document what has changed. This helps us maintain a clear changelog and version our releases properly.

### Steps to Add a Changeset

1. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run changeset
   ```

2. You'll be prompted to:
   - Select the type of change (patch, minor, or major)
     - **patch**: Bug fixes, small improvements (e.g., `0.0.6` → `0.0.7`)
     - **minor**: New features, backward-compatible changes (e.g., `0.0.6` → `0.1.0`)
     - **major**: Breaking changes (e.g., `0.0.6` → `1.0.0`)
   - Write a summary of your changes

3. A new markdown file will be created in `.changeset/` directory with a random name (e.g., `cool-cats-dance.md`)

4. Commit this changeset file along with your code changes

### Example

```bash
$ npm run changeset
🦋  What kind of change is this for oauth-connector? (current version is 0.0.6)
❯ patch
  minor
  major

🦋  Please enter a summary for this change:
> Fixed token refresh issue in CatalystCacheStorageStrategy
```

### What Happens Next?

When your PR is merged to the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Detect the changeset
2. Bump the version in `package.json`
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with your changes
4. Build the package
5. Publish to npm
6. Create a git tag for the new version

### Important Notes

- **Always add a changeset** when making changes that should be included in the changelog
- Changesets are automatically consumed during the release process
- If you forget to add a changeset, your changes won't be included in the next release
- You can add multiple changesets in a single PR if needed
